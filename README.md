# 1.Introduction

This Project serves as an `exhibition` of what I have learned and accompanished during 2020.2-2021.6 in OxSoft (A local software company in my hometown).
I worked as a remote front-end Engineer while I am doing my Ph.D in Spain.


This Project is a `pure` front end Project without any server involved, though the JSON data are retrived with `axios` from a mock server: `/static/mock/index.js`

Vue.JS+ CSS3+ Element UI
all icons are from `https://www.iconfont.cn`
Vue.JS: using Vuex for global and Vue Router.
